        <h1 class="title">Santiago</h1>
        <p class="paragraph"> Today, the Dominican Republic's second largest city affectionately dubbed “Ciudad Corazón” or the city in the heart of the Cibao Valley is a modern and cosmopolitan center thriving in commerce, finance, education, and services, and pulsating with culture.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Towering over its sprawling urban streets, the Monumento a Los Héroes de la Restauración affectionately called "El Monumento" is the city's chief landmark and social hub, where residents and visitors gather on its lawns, but also serves as a constant reminder of the men who regained the DR's independence from Spain in 1865. Looming in the distance is the Cordillera Central mountain range, replete with hiking adventures. History, arts, and culture are never far in Santiago Centro Cultural León offers a comprehensive display of the country's rich heritage and are part and parcel of this significant region as birthplace of the Mirabal Sisters, as well as several Dominican presidents. Home to universities, the area also brims with a dynamic population of millennials, amid professionals, all of whom enjoy the city's vibrant entertainment and nightlife, boasting over 100 discos, bars, and lounges within the downtown area.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Cultured, innovative, and fast-paced: that's Santiago. Yet minutes outside city limits, the peaceful sight of mountains and cool air whisk you away from the hustle and bustle, plunging you into the stunning Cibao heartland.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The airport, Cibao International Airport (STI) is located about half an hour from the city center.

        <h1 class="title">Santo Domingo</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">After Christopher Columbus's arrival on the island in 1492, Santo Domingo became the site of the first cathedral, hospital, customs house and university in the Americas. This colonial town, founded in 1498, was laid out on a grid pattern that became the model for almost all town planners in the New World.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The Dominican Republic's capital city, Santo Domingo is also the most modern and dynamic metropolis in the Caribbean. La Capital—as it is affectionately called—epitomizes the pulse of Dominican culture, where the old and the new converge seamlessly from centuries old architecture and history to large shopping malls, art galleries, an electric nightlife, and a booming gastronomy scene. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">The airport, Santo Domingo (SDQ) is located about half an hour from the city center.

        <h1 class="title">Punta Cana</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">It's a region known for its 32km stretch of beaches and clear waters. The Bávaro area and Punta Cana combine to form what's known as La Costa del Coco, or the Coconut Coast, an area of lavish, all-inclusive resorts. It's popular for zip-lining, windsurfing, kayaking and sailing. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Blessed with one of the Caribbean region's longest white sand coastlines, a whopping 48 kilometers (30 miles), punctuated with sky-reaching coconut palms, Punta Cana is the land of rest and relaxation by the sea. Here, where the Atlantic meets the Caribbean, from the northern tip at Uvero Alto to the southern at Cap Cana, all-inclusive resorts and boutique hideaways offer all the whims and comforts of modern beachfront living. Families enjoy miniature entertainment centers and water parks for children, while couples-only enclaves boast dream wedding locations, with secluded beachside lodging for an ultra-romantic stay.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The airport, Punta Cana (PUJ) is located about half an hour to an hour from the hotels.
